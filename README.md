## Development Ethos
- *It's OK to break stuff on development. Take the ownership and send the fix.*
- *Help other people while reviewing the PR. and Be respectful if somebody needs to improve something on their code. The goal is to work together and have some fun.*
- *If you can, use a ton of emojis while reviewing the PR or replying to comments in the PR. ;)*
- *Don't shy away from sending a PR, we are more than happy to help you out in the process.*

## Code Strucutre
The philosophy of the code strucutre is keeping things as small as they can be. We love Minions. Who doesn't. Keeping functions small, components small, and files small. And also you should be able to work under component directory. What we mean by that, you should't go out of the corresponding main component to do anythings unless you are making some utility function or css which might be useful through out the app. It's like if you have some work in the village then you should find everything in that village, which helps you to do complete the work. And you don't need to visit the complex city area to get your work done. All tools should be available near the work area(redux actions, state, api calls and constant file). let's face it, it's tiring and a bit complex when we have to travel far away directories. Here we want that root component contains everything realted with that component and you should stay inside that component as much as you can and you don't need to worry about what's happening in other parts of the application.( less conflict when working in parallel with other developers) 
<br/><br/>
For example, we have component called `Course` all the api, redux, redux-saga, and constant should stay inside this component directory. So if someone wants to build a feature in the course section or course related feature, he/she/they don't need to go outside this componenent directory. and their cognitive load doesn't need to worry about other parts of the application. We have a `redux` folder in root components which takes care of the component related api calls, redux state, and redux-saga handlers. 
<br/><br/>
Note: Global constants will go in global `src/constant.js` file.
  
- Component(It could be root component which has all the child component which belongs to this component. i.e see `Course` component)
  - redux(Root level component will have all the redux realted things of this component.)
  -Child1Component
  -Child2Component
  -..otherChildComponents
  - constant.js( Constants which are related with this component or to child component)
  - index.js
  - styles.scss

### How to do an API call and manage state
 The whole point of using redux and redux saga is that we can have a structure around managing the state of the application. If you are not new to redux and redux saga, Don't be afraid, it's not that complex. Sure, there is so much information about out there on redux and redux saga. But you just need to have a basic idea to use it. or we are here to help you if you don't understand something. We will walk you thought it, or we can also help you to create your first api call through redux and redux saga. Just ask one of us, and we are more than happy to help you. 

 So let's learn something about how we use redux and redux-saga in our code. There are basically 4 things.
 - Actions
 - Redux State
 - Redux middlewars(aka redux-saga)
 - API calls

TODO: add a visual image how the above things interact with each other.

So if you want to do a API call, the idea would be :-> <br/> <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`Create middlewares(saga)`</br> </br>

### Create actions
Actions is just a fancy of saying and hadling API request, What kind of action(redux action) we should dispatch on `when we call the api`, `what to do on successful api call`, and `what action to dispatch when api fails or it's not a successful operation`
To do a API call, first we define `actions`. And we define it in the `src/components/componentName/redux/action.js` file. Let's take an example of getting user information. and How we can define actions for that. 
the actions would look like something below. 

```
export const types = {
  GET_USER_INTENT: 'GET_USER_INTENT',
  GET_USER_INTENT_RESOLVED: 'GET_USER_INTENT_RESOLVED',
  GET_USER_INTENT_REJECTED: 'GET_USER_INTENT_REJECTED',
}

export const actions = {
  getUser(data) {
    return {
      type: types.GET_USER_INTENT,
      data,
    }
  },
  getUserResolved(data) {
    return {
      type: types.GET_USER_INTENT_RESOLVED,
      data,
    }
  },
  getUserRejected(error) {
    return {
      type: types.GET_USER_INTENT_REJECTED,
      error,
    }
  },
}

```

### Create redux state 
For state related things, we create and manage state in `src/components/componentName/redux/reducer.js`. The code looks like this. 

```
import { types } from './action'

const initialState = {
  loading: false,
  error: false,
  data: null,
}

export default (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case types.GET_USER_INTENT:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: true,
        error: false,
        data: null,
      }
    case types.GET_USER_INTENT_RESOLVED:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        error: false,
        data: action.data, // mapped user data.
      }

    case types.GET_USER_INTENT_REJECTED:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        error: action.error, // keeping reference of the error, When API call fails.
        data: null,
      }

    default:
      return state
  }
}

```

### Create API functions

To create API calss in the backend, we create API calls here. Mostly we do with `axios` in `src/components/componentName/redux/api.js`. The API call looks like this.

```
import axios from 'axios'
import { METHODS, HeaderFactory } from '../../../services/api'

/**
 * gets user data from the server.
 *
 * @param {opts} 
 * @param {object} opts
 * @returns {Promise}
 */
export const getUserData = (opts, tokens) => {
  return axios({
    url: `${process.env.REACT_APP_MERAKI_URL}/users/${opts.userId}`,
    method: METHODS.GET,
    headers: HeaderFactory(tokens),
    data: {
      "idToken": opts.idToken,
      "mode": "web",
    }
  })
}
```

### Redux middlewars(aka redux-saga) 
Middlewares are so useful, when we talk about handling async/api calls. We put saga middlewares in `src/components/componentName/redux/saga.js` file.
It makes handling redux state easy and intutive. In start it might look a bit cumbersome or long. But after creating two or three api calls, you will get a hang of it. This is how we handle getting user data in through redux saga middleware. 

```
import { takeLatest, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'

import { types, actions } from './action'
import { authorizeRequest, httpStatuses } from '../../../services/auth'
import { getUserData } from './api'

/**
 * This handles gets user data from the server
 * @param {object} data user information
 * @param {object} data.userId user id which will be used to get user information
*/
function* handleGetUserData({ data }) {
  const res = yield call( authorizeRequest,getUserData, data)
  if(httpStatuses.SUCCESS.includes(res.status)) {
    // if the api call was succesful, let's change the status according // to that. also setting `loading` as false. 
    yield put(actions.getUserResolved(res.data))
  } else {
    // if the api call wasn't successful, let's set the error in redux /// for refernce.also setting `loading` as false. 
    yield put(actions.getUserRejected(res))
  } 
}

export default function* () {
  // This action `types.GET_USER_INTENT` is also handled in the redux
  // it sets `loading` as true. so we can show some loader when api call
  // is happening.
  yield takeLatest(types.GET_USER_INTENT, handleGetUserData)
}

```
