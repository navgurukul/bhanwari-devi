            Meraki is part of Navgurukul Foundation for Social Welfare. It
            started in 2020 as an effort to bring low cost online tech education
            to students from low income families across India. Navgurukul
            already runs successful campus programmes across India and Meraki is
            an extension of that effort.

            In our pursuit, we have been helped by numerous volunteers, partners

            NGOs to cater to their students or just individual students.
